## With a borderless world comes superb opportunities.

Hey dude! This is **Jakson Jos√©**, I've been focused on **Full Stack Dev**. Working on a range of technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js.

I'm a kind of self-taught person and fascinated by technology, mainly about programming. Also, I believe software development can assist companies and people by solving issues, advancing business, and get people a better life.
